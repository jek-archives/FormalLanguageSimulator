Topic 3: Text Search Engine and Bioinformatics					
"This project explores formal languages in information retrieval and biological sequence analysis. You will implement a search system where user queries are expressed as regular expressions, which are compiled into NFAs for flexible matching and then optionally converted to DFAs for performance optimization. The collection of all strings matching a given pattern constitutes a regular language, and you will show how these languages can be generated by regular grammars. 

For biological sequences, you will extend finite state machines to handle approximate pattern matching while remaining within the regular language recognition. When dealing with structural elements like RNA secondary structures or XML document validation, you will implement Pushdown Automata that recognize context-free languages, demonstrating where regular languages become insufficient and more powerful automata are necessary. 

Develop a simulator using C++ that will provide a clear visualization of how different classes of formal languages solve different types of pattern recognition problems.
